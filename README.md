Types of RAG 



What is Agentic RAG?

Agentic RAG builds upon traditional RAG by introducing agents — autonomous decision-making entities capable of dynamic task execution. Unlike static retrieval processes, Agentic RAG leverages agents to adapt workflows based on context, integrating tools like APIs, databases, and external functions.

Core Features of Agentic RAG

Dynamic Workflows: Agents decide how to handle a task — whether to retrieve data, call APIs, or combine multiple tools.
Real-Time Integration: Access live information, such as weather updates or stock prices, through APIs.
Multi-Step Reasoning: Handle complex queries that require layered logic or decision-making.
Scalability: Easily extendable to various domains, from customer support to healthcare.
