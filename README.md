### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
🚀 Enhancing AI with Knowledge Retrieval

**Introduction**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve AI-generated responses. By enabling models to access external knowledge, it enhances accuracy and provides more informed answers.

**Types of RAG**
1. **Traditional RAG**
2. **Agentic RAG (Advanced & Adaptive)**

#### 📌 Traditional RAG
Traditional RAG improves language models by retrieving relevant documents before generating responses, grounding outputs in external knowledge sources, and enhancing factual accuracy.

**Key Features of Traditional RAG:**
- **Document Retrieval:** Fetches contextually relevant data from databases.
- **Augmented Generation:** Uses retrieved documents to generate informed responses.
- **Static Query Processing:** Follows a fixed pattern for retrieval.

#### 🤖 Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG introduces autonomous agents that dynamically execute tasks based on context. Unlike static retrieval, agents adaptively decide the best course of action.

**Core Features of Agentic RAG:**
- **Dynamic Workflows:** Agents determine the best way to process a task—retrieving data, calling APIs, or using multiple tools.
- **Real-Time Integration:** Access live information (e.g., stock prices, weather updates) via APIs.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Handles complex queries requiring layered logic and decision-making.
- **Scalability:** Adaptable to various domains, such as customer support, finance, and healthcare.

**How Does Agentic RAG Work?**
1. **User Query:** The agent analyzes the request.
2. **Decision Making:** The agent decides whether to retrieve data, call APIs, or perform a computation.
3. **Execution:** The chosen method is executed dynamically.
4. **Response Generation:** The AI generates a context-aware response.

**Why Use Agentic RAG?**
| Feature                | Traditional RAG | Agentic RAG        |
|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Static Query Processing| ✅ Yes          | ❌ No (Dynamic)    |
| API Integration        | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes             |
| Decision-Making Agents | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes             |
| Real-Time Data Access  | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes             |
| Multi-Step Reasoning   | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes             |
