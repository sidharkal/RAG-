Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
🚀 Enhancing AI with Knowledge Retrieval

Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve AI-generated responses. It enables models to access external knowledge, enhancing accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


Types of RAG
Traditional RAG
Agentic RAG (Advanced & Adaptive)
📌 What is Traditional RAG?
Traditional RAG enhances language models by retrieving relevant documents before generating responses. It improves factual accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge sources.



Key Features:
✔ Document Retrieval: Fetches contextually relevant data from databases.
✔ Augmented Generation: Uses retrieved documents to generate informed responses.
✔ Static Query Processing: The retrieval process follows a fixed pattern.



🤖 What is Agentic RAG?
Agentic RAG evolves beyond traditional RAG by introducing autonomous agents that can dynamically execute tasks based on context. Instead of static retrieval, agents decide the best course of action, leveraging APIs, databases, and external functions.


⚡ Core Features of Agentic RAG:
✅ Dynamic Workflows: Agents decide how to process a task—retrieving data, calling APIs, or combining multiple tools.
✅ Real-Time Integration: Access live information (e.g., stock prices, weather updates) via APIs.
✅ Multi-Step Reasoning: Solve complex queries requiring layered logic and decision-making.
✅ Scalability: Adaptable to various domains, such as customer support, finance, and healthcare.


🛠 How Does Agentic RAG Work?
1️⃣ User Query → The agent analyzes the request.
2️⃣ Decision Making → The agent chooses whether to retrieve data, call APIs, or perform a computation.
3️⃣ Execution → The chosen method is executed dynamically.
4️⃣ Response Generation → The AI generates a context-aware response.
